# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Crystal Project Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the Crystal project with shard.yml, directory structure, and development dependencies
# Details:
Create a new Crystal shard with the following structure:
- Initialize with `crystal init lib unit`
- Configure shard.yml with name: unit, version: 0.1.0, crystal: "~> 1.14"
- Add development dependencies: ameba (^1.6.1) for linting, crystal-coverage for test coverage
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD with Crystal 1.14.0
- Create .editorconfig with Crystal conventions (2 spaces, LF line endings)
- Add .gitignore for Crystal projects including /lib/, /bin/, /.shards/
- Create initial src/unit.cr entry point file
- Set up spec/spec_helper.cr with require "spec" and require "../src/unit"

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure with: crystal spec --error-on-warnings, shards install completes successfully, ameba runs without errors, crystal build src/unit.cr produces no compilation errors

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Crystal project with crystal init [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the base Crystal library structure using the crystal init command
### Details:
Execute `crystal init lib unit` to create the initial project structure. This will generate the basic directory layout including src/, spec/, and initial files like README.md and shard.yml. Verify that the generated structure includes src/unit.cr as the main entry point and spec/unit_spec.cr for tests.

## 2. Configure shard.yml with project metadata and dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up shard.yml with correct project information and add development dependencies
### Details:
Update the generated shard.yml file to include: name: unit, version: 0.1.0, crystal: "~> 1.14". Add development dependencies section with ameba (^1.6.1) for code linting and crystal-coverage for test coverage reporting. Ensure proper YAML formatting and indentation throughout the file.

## 3. Create GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up continuous integration with GitHub Actions for automated testing and linting
### Details:
Create .github/workflows/ci.yml file with a workflow that: uses Crystal 1.14.0, runs on Ubuntu latest, executes `shards install`, runs `crystal spec --error-on-warnings`, runs `crystal tool format --check`, and executes ameba for linting. Include caching for shards dependencies to speed up builds.

## 4. Configure development environment files [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create .editorconfig and .gitignore files with Crystal-specific settings
### Details:
Create .editorconfig with Crystal conventions: indent_style = space, indent_size = 2, end_of_line = lf, charset = utf-8, trim_trailing_whitespace = true, insert_final_newline = true. Set up .gitignore to exclude: /lib/, /bin/, /.shards/, *.dwarf, and other Crystal build artifacts. Also ignore coverage reports and temporary files.

## 5. Set up initial source files and test helpers [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Create the main entry point and configure the test spec helper
### Details:
Ensure src/unit.cr exists with proper module definition: `module Unit; VERSION = "0.1.0"; end`. Update spec/spec_helper.cr to include `require "spec"` and `require "../src/unit"`. Add any additional test configuration needed for crystal-coverage integration. Create a basic smoke test in spec/unit_spec.cr to verify the module loads correctly.
