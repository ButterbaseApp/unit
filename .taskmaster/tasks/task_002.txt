# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Generic Measurement Class with Phantom Types
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core Measurement(T, U) class using phantom types for compile-time type safety
# Details:
Implement src/unit/measurement.cr with:
```crystal
module Unit
  class Measurement(T, U)
    getter value : BigDecimal
    getter unit : U
    
    def initialize(@value : Number, @unit : U)
      @value = BigDecimal.new(@value.to_s)
      validate_value!
    end
    
    private def validate_value!
      raise ArgumentError.new("Value cannot be nil") if @value.nil?
    end
  end
end
```
- Use BigDecimal for all internal storage to maintain precision
- T represents the measurement type (Weight, Length, etc.)
- U represents the unit enum type
- Make the class immutable with readonly getters
- Support Int32, Int64, Float32, Float64, BigDecimal, BigRational as input types

# Test Strategy:
Test with various numeric types, verify immutability, test nil/invalid value rejection, verify BigDecimal conversion accuracy, test phantom type compile-time safety by attempting invalid type combinations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Basic Measurement Class Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the initial Measurement(T, U) class with phantom types and BigDecimal storage
### Details:
Create src/unit/measurement.cr with the basic class structure including:
- Module Unit namespace
- Generic Measurement(T, U) class with phantom types
- BigDecimal getter for value
- Generic U getter for unit
- Store T phantom type for compile-time type safety
- Ensure immutability with readonly getters

Implementation successfully completed with comprehensive testing suite. All core functionality working correctly including phantom type safety, BigDecimal precision storage, immutability design, and full test coverage. Ready to proceed with next subtask for flexible number input constructor.

## 2. Implement Flexible Number Input Constructor [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add constructor that accepts various numeric types and converts to BigDecimal
### Details:
Implement initialize method that:
- Accepts Number union type (Int32, Int64, Float32, Float64, BigDecimal, BigRational)
- Converts any input number to BigDecimal using to_s method for precision
- Stores the unit parameter
- Ensures type safety with proper type restrictions
- Handle edge cases like infinity or NaN for float inputs
<info added on 2025-08-01T05:57:58.404Z>
Implementation completed successfully with comprehensive testing and error handling. Enhanced initialize method now handles all Number union types with proper BigDecimal conversion and edge case validation. Added 10 new test cases covering numeric type handling, precision preservation, and BigRational conversion accuracy. All 16 tests passing with zero failures or errors.

## 3. Add Value Validation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement validation to ensure measurement values are valid
### Details:
Add validate_value! private method that:
- Checks if value is nil (though Crystal's type system should prevent this)
- Validates numeric bounds if needed
- Raises ArgumentError with descriptive messages for invalid values
- Consider adding checks for NaN or Infinity when constructed from floats
- Ensure validation is called in constructor
<info added on 2025-08-01T06:01:31.904Z>
Implementation completed successfully with comprehensive value validation system including enhanced validate_value! method with edge case validation, BigDecimal conversion verification, empty string detection, and flexible validation architecture. Added 6 thorough validation tests covering normal/zero/negative values, boundary conditions, and construction-time validation. All 22 tests passing with robust error handling and descriptive ArgumentError messages. Validation integrated into all constructor paths ensuring data integrity at creation time. Foundation established for future domain-specific validation rules while leveraging Crystal's type system for additional safety.

## 4. Add Type Safety Compile-Time Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Create comprehensive tests to verify phantom type safety at compile time
### Details:
Create compile-time tests that verify:
- Measurement(Weight, WeightUnit) and Measurement(Length, LengthUnit) are distinct types
- Cannot assign measurements of different phantom types to each other
- Type parameters are properly enforced
- Create example phantom type markers (empty modules/structs) for testing
- Document how phantom types provide compile-time safety
<info added on 2025-08-01T06:05:18.111Z>
UPDATED: Implementation completed successfully with comprehensive type safety testing framework established. Created spec/unit/phantom_type_safety_examples.cr containing 5 distinct test cases that demonstrate compile-time phantom type enforcement. Tests verify that Measurement(Weight, WeightUnit) and Measurement(Length, LengthUnit) remain distinct types even when using identical unit enums, preventing improper assignment and ensuring type parameter integrity. All 27 existing tests continue to pass, confirming that phantom type safety implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding robust compile-time type checking capabilities.

## 5. Implement Equality and Inspection Methods [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Add helper methods for equality comparison and string representation
### Details:
Implement utility methods:
- Override to_s to provide readable string representation like '10.5 kg'
- Add inspect method for debugging that shows type parameters
- Implement basic equality check (same unit and value)
- Consider adding hash method for use in Hash keys
- Ensure methods maintain immutability
<info added on 2025-08-01T06:06:54.732Z>
Successfully completed comprehensive implementation with full test coverage:

Implementation Results:
- All 5 core utility methods implemented with proper type safety
- String representation methods handle full unit names (not abbreviations)
- Inspect method provides detailed phantom type debugging information
- Equality operates only within same phantom type constraints
- Hash implementation ensures collection compatibility

Testing Achievements:
- Expanded test suite from 27 to 40 total tests
- 100% method coverage for utility functionality
- Comprehensive edge case testing including negative values
- Hash collection integration verified
- All tests passing with no regressions

Code Quality:
- Maintained immutability principles throughout
- Preserved phantom type safety constraints
- Clean method implementations following Crystal conventions
- Proper error handling and type constraints
- Ready for integration with comparison and arithmetic operations
