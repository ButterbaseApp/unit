			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Crystal Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Crystal project initialization into separate subtasks for: 1) Basic project setup with crystal init, 2) Configuring shard.yml with dependencies, 3) Setting up development tools (ameba, coverage), 4) Creating GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow, 5) Adding project configuration files (.editorconfig, .gitignore), 6) Creating initial source structure and entry points",
			"reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, this task involves multiple distinct setup steps across different tools and configurations. Each subtask is independent and can be verified separately."
